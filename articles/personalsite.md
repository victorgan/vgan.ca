Lagom är bäst
-------------
The Swedes have a word they like using: Lagom. It has no direct translation, but
it's an adjective that roughly means "just right" or "the perfect amount". I
tried to follow this line of thought to prevent overdesigning this site. This
meant trying for a site that looks crisp, but doesn't draw attention to
itself so the focus is kept on the content. 

Plus, it'll be simpler.

Imitation
---------
This site is pretty much a rip of Steve Losh's.

Hakyll
------
I chose to use static HTML pages for my site and host it myself. Technically
it's the simplest way to distribute content as there's no database involved or
dynamic requests. It's is a good idea for people who just want a simple blog
because of its inherent security, stability and fast loading pages. It's a bad
idea for people who rely on dynamic content or just want to get a blog up and
running without caring about how the internals work.

There are some tools to make it easier so you don't have to write duplicate
HTML, among other things. [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) is what I chose,
although it's not exactly straightforward to fully grasp if you don't know
Haskell. I chose it because of Haskell. Jekyll and Hyde are others.

Typography
----------
The default sans-serif fonts look good in small sizes but I don't like how they
look when they're above around 14px. Conversely serif typefaces in larger
sizes let their shapes be fully appreciated. I also like the alternative
ligatures in some italicised serifs. 

The sizes of the types should be multiples of each other for pure geometric
satisfaction. So if the body text is 20px, the other font sizes must be 10px,
20px, 40px or 60px.  Keeping a vertical
[Rhythm](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/settingtypeontheweb/) is easy when
this is done: if the line height of 20px text is 25px, then everything aligns to
a 25px vertical grid. 

Palatino at 20px is for the body text. Though the [legibility
benefits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif#Readability_and_legibility) of
serif typefaces are disputed, I like its associations with print formats.  I'm
foregoing the oft-used 18px because it doesn't give an even multiplier to the
25px line height, and the slight increase in size may give the site a distinct
feel. Demphasized half-sized sans-serifs are sprinkled around for contrast and the
doubly and triply large headers are in an italicised display font completing the
typeface trifecta (of too much thought).

Layout
------
The width of the page is limited as various pseudo-science points to 66 
characters per line as being optimal for reading, but moreso because it makes
the site seem less intimidating. 

The navigation goes on top so there is only one thing to focus on at any given
horizontal line. 

Colour
------
Introducing a colour into the site's foundation makes it hard to match so I
attempted to use as little as possible, except for the links which are a cool
shade of cerulean turquoise.
